# Navigating the filesystem

```
whoami                         # who you are
pwd                            # print working directory
cd                             # used to change directory
who                            # show all users logged on
```

# Getting information or help

```
man <command>                  # displays the manual page for <command>

```

It's important to understand the general *anatomy* of a command. The
top of a `man` page explains it for any given command.

What if you can't find the `man` page?

```
apropos <string>               # lists man pages potential pertinent to <string>
```


# `less` -- a pagination program
```
less <file>                    # paginate thru file
```

`man` is really displayed with `less`
