# Navigating the filesystem

```
whoami                         # who you are
pwd                            # print working directory
cd                             # used to change directory

# Getting information or help

```
type <command>                 # what kind of 'verb' is <command>
man <command>                  # displays the manual page for <command>
apropos <string>               # lists man pages potential pertinent to <string>
```

# `less` -- a pagination program
```
less <file>                    # paginate thru file
```

`man` is really displayed with `less`
